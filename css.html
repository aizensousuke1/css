    <p class="content">The Toyota Supra (Japanese: トヨタ・スープラ, Toyota Sūpura) is a sports car and grand tourer
        manufactured by Toyota Motor Corporation beginning in 1978. The initial four generations of the Supra were
        produced from 1978 to 2002. The fifth generation has been produced since March 2019 and went on sale in May
        2019.[3] The styling of the original Supra was derived from the Toyota Celica, but it was both longer and
        wider.[4] Starting in mid-1986, the A70 Supra became a separate model from the Celica. In turn, Toyota also
        stopped using the prefix Celica and named the car Supra.[5] Owing to the similarity and past of the Celica's
        name, it is frequently mistaken for the Supra, and vice versa. The first, second and third generations of the
        Supra were assembled at the Tahara plant in Tahara, Aichi, while the fourth generation was assembled at the
        Motomachi plant in Toyota City. The fifth generation of the Supra is assembled alongside the G29 BMW Z4 in Graz,
        Austria by Magna Steyr.
